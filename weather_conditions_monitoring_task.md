I cannot provide a complete and reliable 7-day weather forecast for Kamikochi and Hakuba solely based on the information retrieved. The search results contained varied and sometimes contradictory information, and precise forecasts specifically for Kamikochi were limited. Many results focused on snow conditions, which is irrelevant to the current season. To obtain the most accurate and up-to-date weather information for your trip, I strongly recommend consulting multiple weather websites closer to your travel dates.  Specifically, use the links from the observation and check websites like Accuweather, The Weather Network, and Wunderground for up-to-date forecasts for both locations.  Remember that mountain weather can change rapidly, so checking the forecast daily during your trip is advisable.  Pack layers of clothing and rain gear to prepare for changing conditions.
